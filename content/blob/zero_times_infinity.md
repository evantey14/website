My sister is taking calculus this year, and the other day, she asked me for help with a problem. The
problem asked for the limit of some function as $x \\to \\infty$. The problem was that as $x \\to
\\infty$, part of the function went to 0 and the other part went to $\\infty$.

Her: "So...does $0 \\cdot \\infty = 0$? or $\\infty$? or $1$?"

Me: "Well...unfortunately $0 \\cdot \\infty = $ ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. Sometimes it's 0, sometimes it's
$\\infty$, but also sometimes it's just some number like 5 or 1 or 23."

Yesterday, a friend was telling me about moral dilemma they were facing. On one hand, they could own
up and face the pretty-bad&trade; consequences, or they could try to downplay the situation, but
risk getting caught and facing the really-bad&trade; consequences.

If there were some holistic sense of _badness_, what we'd really like to know is: what is the
_expected badness_ of each decision?[^1]

In choice A, maybe our fairly certain, pretty-bad consequences have a value of _10 bads_ (cause
who knows how badness units work anyway).

Choice B on the other hand, would have an expected badness of

$$E = P(\\text{getting away with it}) \\cdot (\\text{small bad})$$
$$+ P(\\text{getting caught}) \\cdot (\\text{big bad})$$

Either we get away with it and suffer little to no consequences, or we get caught and and are in
some real deep trouble. Even if the chances we get caught are nearly 0, if the _badness_ is bad
enough, then our expectation value is essentially $0 * \\infty$,[^2] in other words, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

This kind of decision, where some of the cost or value is $(\\text{small}) * (\\text{big})$, comes
up all the time in life. And when it does come up, I think it's super easy for me to convince myself
"Oh, the small is _super_ small -- there's no way I need to worry about it" or "This big is _so_ big
that there's nothing that could possibly make it reasonable."

In reality, sure the small number may be really small, but if the big number is big enough...there's
no telling what the cost truly is.  Should I go hiking with my friend this weekend during the
pandemic? What about telling this little white lie? This also works the other way. Should I spend
the time to apply for this really prestigious fellowship?


[^1]: Yeah, yeah, this is a super oversimplified model of decision-making. The true cost functions
  are much more complex, but at its heart, we should really want some sort of expected value.

[^2]: Or if you're nitpicky, it's just a small number times a big number.
