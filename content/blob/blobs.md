Welcome to my collection of text blobs! I'm hoping to use this kinda like a blog, but in smaller
blobs. I think most blogs I read -- actually most texts I read -- are a bit too blobby. They sprawl
around, hitting lots of different points that may be related hierarchically or laterally. Sometimes
they have examples, or supporting anecdotes, or rebuttals to counter arguments, meaning most of the
time, it's harder to distill useful information or connections.

I think generally, when I'm "reading" text anyway, I'm usually just skimming through all that stuff
for the useful information in the first place. This was how I was actually taught to read
academic papers. This is also definitely how I browse the internet.

Maybe the problem is just that I'm too _lazy_, but reading all the words then filtering and
structuring the information in my head is just lots of work (especially if the author's done that
work already!). Most of the time, I find myself wishing the author had just published a concise
outline along-side their blobs of text. So, maybe, instead of continuing to write blobs of text we
should try to come up with new, exciting, concise mediums of communication.

Outlines, images, gifs, and videos, are all great kinda-natural media that have developed alongside
technology and give us better ways to communicate information. Now seems to be a great time, though,
to be really intentional about these methods of communication.
[Interactives](https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/) / [explorable
explanations](https://explorabl.es/) are really intriguing ways to understand things like causality
while really leveraging modern tech. More exciting, I think there's still lots of room to discover
new ways of structuring or communicating different kinds of information for different contexts.

All that said, though, I'll still probably be mostly writing text blobs :p, because
blobs of text are almost always easier to write efficiently. (They also have a nice touch of
mirroring thoughts / the thought process more than most methods.)
